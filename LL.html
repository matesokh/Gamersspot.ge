            <p>League of Legends is a popular online multiplayer battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by
                Riot Games. Released in 2009, it has grown into one of the most played and watched esports titles
                worldwide. In the game, two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team’s Nexus, located
                in their base, while defending their own. Each player chooses a unique "champion" with distinct
                abilities and roles, such as tank, support, mage, or marksman.
                The main map, called Summoner’s Rift, features three lanes, a jungle, and various strategic objectives
                like towers, dragons, and the powerful Baron Nashor. Success in League of Legends depends on teamwork,
                strategy, mechanical skill, and communication.
                League is known not only for its gameplay but also for its expanding universe, with deep lore, animated
                videos, music projects, and even the Netflix series Arcane. Riot Games regularly updates the game with
                new champions, skins, and balance changes, keeping it fresh and competitive.
                The game has a massive professional scene, with major leagues in regions like North America (LCS),
                Europe (LEC), Korea (LCK), and China (LPL), culminating in the annual World Championship, one of the
                biggest events in esports.</p>
