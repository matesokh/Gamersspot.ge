            <p>Fortnite is a popular online video game developed by Epic Games, first released in 2017. It became a
                global phenomenon thanks to its unique combination of fast-paced action, building mechanics, and
                colorful cartoon-style graphics. The most well-known mode, Battle Royale, features 100 players competing
                on an island to be the last one standing. Players can collect weapons, build structures, and use a
                variety of items to outlast their opponents.
                What makes Fortnite stand out is its frequent updates and events. Epic Games regularly introduces new
                content, such as weapons, skins, emotes, and seasonal themes, which keep the game feeling fresh and
                exciting. The game has also hosted massive virtual concerts and crossover events with famous franchises
                like Marvel, Star Wars, and Dragon Ball, blending gaming with pop culture in groundbreaking ways.
                Fortnite is free to play and available on multiple platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo
                Switch, and mobile devices. While the base game costs nothing, players can purchase a Battle Pass or
                cosmetic items to customize their characters. With its combination of creative gameplay, competitive
                action, and community-driven content, Fortnite has become more than a gameâ€”it's a cultural icon.</p>
