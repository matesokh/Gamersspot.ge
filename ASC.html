                Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is an action-RPG game developed by Ubisoft and released in 2018. Set during the
                Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta in ancient Greece (around 431 BCE), the game lets players
                step into the sandals of either Alexios or Kassandra, mercenaries with a mysterious past. As descendants
                of Leonidas, they possess powerful abilities and a rich family history tied to the legendary First
                Civilization.
                Odyssey offers a massive open world filled with historical landmarks, stunning landscapes, and mythical
                creatures. Players explore the Aegean Sea, participate in epic naval battles, and make moral choices
                that shape the story. The game is known for its deep RPG mechanics, including dialogue trees, branching
                quests, and multiple endings. It introduces the “mercenary system,” where enemies hunt the player based
                on their notoriety.
                Mythology plays a major role, blending history with fantasy as players battle creatures like the
                Minotaur and Medusa. Famous historical figures such as Socrates and Pericles also appear, adding to the
                game’s rich atmosphere. With its breathtaking visuals, engaging combat, and emotional narrative,
                Assassin’s Creed Odyssey stands out as one of the franchise’s most ambitious titles. It’s not just a
                game — it’s an odyssey through the heart of ancient Greece.
