            <p>Call of Duty is one of the most iconic and influential first-person shooter video game franchises in the
                world. Developed originally by Infinity Ward and published by Activision, the series began in 2003 with
                a focus on World War II battles. Over the years, it has evolved to include modern warfare, futuristic
                combat, and even Cold War-era missions. Known for its intense single-player campaigns and fast-paced
                multiplayer modes, Call of Duty has captivated millions of players worldwide.
                Each title in the series delivers cinematic storytelling, realistic graphics, and smooth gameplay
                mechanics. Popular entries like Modern Warfare, Black Ops, and Warzone have set new standards in online
                gaming. Call of Duty: Warzone, the franchise’s free-to-play battle royale, brought a massive open-world
                combat experience and has become a global phenomenon.
                What truly sets Call of Duty apart is its ability to blend realism with adrenaline-filled action.
                Whether you’re fighting in historical battles or engaging in futuristic warfare, the game pulls you in
                with its immersive design and gripping scenarios. With new releases every year and a loyal community,
