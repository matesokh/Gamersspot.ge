            <p>Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5), developed by Rockstar Games, is more than just a game—this is not just a
                game, it's a legend. Released in 2013, GTA 5 has become one of the most iconic open-world
                action-adventure games ever created. Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, the game offers a massive,
                detailed world filled with life, crime, chaos, and opportunity. Players follow the lives of three unique
                characters—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with their own storylines, skills, and personalities.
                The game blends fast-paced action, clever storytelling, and a vast sandbox environment, allowing players
                to drive, fly, shoot, explore, and even build empires. GTA Online, the multiplayer mode, adds endless
                replay value with missions, races, heists, and player-created content.
                What truly sets GTA 5 apart is its cultural impact. It's not only a best-seller but a phenomenon that
                continues to attract millions of players worldwide, even a decade after release. Its stunning graphics,
                immersive gameplay, and dark humor make it unforgettable. Whether you're stealing cars, running from the
                cops, or just exploring the city, GTA 5 delivers a legendary experience. This is not just a game, it’s a
                legend.</p>
