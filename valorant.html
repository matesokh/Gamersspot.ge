            <p>Valorant is a popular free-to-play first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, released in 2020.
                Combining precise gunplay with unique character abilities, Valorant quickly became a standout title in
                the tactical shooter genre. The game features two teams of five players competing in rounds where one
                team attacks and the other defends. The attacking team tries to plant a spike (a bomb-like device),
                while the defending team must stop them or defuse the spike if itâ€™s planted.
                What sets Valorant apart is its roster of "Agents," each with distinct abilities that influence
                gameplay. These abilities include smokescreens, flashes, teleportation, healing, and more, allowing
                players to strategize in creative ways beyond simple shooting mechanics.
                Valorant emphasizes team coordination, quick reflexes, and tactical decision-making. Maps are carefully
                designed with multiple paths, choke points, and verticality to encourage diverse playstyles. The game is
                also known for its strong anti-cheat system and frequent updates that keep gameplay balanced and fresh.
                Thanks to its competitive nature and support from Riot Games, Valorant has developed a thriving esports
                scene with tournaments and global events. Whether you're a casual player or an aspiring pro, Valorant
                offers a challenging and rewarding experience in the world of competitive gaming.</p>
