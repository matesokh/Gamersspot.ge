            <p>Dota 2 is a competitive multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Valve
                Corporation. It was released in 2013 as the sequel to the original Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a
                community-created mod for Warcraft III. In Dota 2, two teams of five players each control powerful
                heroes and battle to destroy the opposing team's Ancient, a large structure located within their base.
                Each hero has unique abilities and plays a specific role such as support, carry, or initiator. The game
                takes place on a map divided into three lanes—top, middle, and bottom—with a jungle in between. Players
                gain gold and experience by defeating enemy heroes, creeps, and objectives, allowing them to level up
                and buy items that enhance their hero’s strength.
                Dota 2 is known for its deep strategy, high skill ceiling, and complex gameplay mechanics. It features
                over 100 heroes, constant updates, and a vast item system that allows for endless playstyles and
                strategies.
                One of Dota 2’s most notable aspects is its esports scene, especially The International, its annual
                world championship with prize pools reaching tens of millions of dollars. This has made Dota 2 one of
                the most lucrative and influential games in competitive gaming history.</p>
